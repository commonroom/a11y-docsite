Digital accessibility can be difficult.

Interpreting the [accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) is one piece of the puzzle. Even learning to maneuver the [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) has a steep learning curve. And that's to say nothing about learning how to use assistive technologies, what policies and regulations are at play, how to conduct audits and tests, or actually design or develop something using accessible patterns and [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/).

This project is an attempt to:

- Aggregate a list of general component types
- Define those the essential elements that constitute those components
- Provide the functional requirements for designing and developing
- Show example technical techniques, not production ready code
- Suggest usability best practices through usage guidelines
- Detail the expected behavior across assistive technologies: pointers, keyboards, screen readers, switches, and so on
