# A11y Docs

A11y Docs help designers and developers understand the functional requirements of accessible components.

## Why?

Digital accessibility can be difficult.

Interpreting the [accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) is one piece of the puzzle. Even learning to maneuver the [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) has a steep learning curve. And that's to say nothing about learning how to use assistive technologies, what policies and regulations are at play, how to conduct audits and tests, or actually design or develop something using accessible patterns and [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/).

There are many, many useful resources around the web. But more and more it seems digital accessibility is less about knowing _how_ to design and build accessible experiences and more about knowing _where_ to look.

A11y Docs is an attempt to aggregate, synthesize, and expand on some of the best digital accessibility content. Designers and developers should have a single, easy-to-reference document for accessibility requirements, and that's exactly what we're building.

## How?

This project is an attempt to:

- Aggregate a list of general component types
- Define those the essential elements that constitute those components
- Provide the functional requirements for designing and developing
- Show example technical techniques, not production ready code
- Suggest usability best practices through usage guidelines
- Detail the expected behavior across assistive technologies: pointers, keyboards, screen readers, switches, and so on
